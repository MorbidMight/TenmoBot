# TenmoBot

TenmoBot is a discord bot which uses the Riot Games API to find the mastery and rank of LOL players. The commands in the server are !masteries <user> and !rank <user>. When setting up the bot ensure that you set the ddragon path in riotAPIMethods and your discord key as well. You also need to set your RIOT_API_KEY enviornment variable.
