#TENMO BOT
TenmoBot is a discord bot which uses the Riot Games API to find the mastery and rank of LOL(ew) players. The commands in the server are !masteries <user> and !rank <user>. I'm not adding anymore because I am lazy. When setting up the bot ensure that you set the ddragon path in riotAPIMethods and your discord key as well. You also need to set your RIOT_API_KEY enviornment variable.
